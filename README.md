# Note-Taker
This is my eleventh challenge assignment for the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp 2022. The challenge is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This app will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve data from a JSON file. It will be deployed on Heroku.
